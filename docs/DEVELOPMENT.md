# Development Guidelines

## Data Storage Strategy

### Database Storage (Firestore)
Store data that is:
- Relatively stable over time
- Core to the application's functionality
- Requires approval or review before changes

Examples:
1. Personality Profiles
   - Holland Code descriptions and base job matches
   - MBTI type descriptions and characteristics
   - Core competencies for each profile

2. Survey Questions
   - Question text and options
   - Scoring rules
   - Category mappings

### Dynamic Code Storage
Store data that is:
- Frequently updated
- Market-dependent
- Region-specific
- Time-sensitive

Examples:
1. Career Information
   - Salary ranges
   - Job market trends
   - Growth projections
   - Career progression paths

2. Training Resources
   - Course listings
   - Certification programs
   - Educational resources
   - Cost information
   - Provider links

3. Technology Trends
   - Emerging tools
   - Industry software
   - New methodologies

## Update Procedures

### Database Updates
1. Create changes in `setup_recommendations.py`
2. Review changes with team
3. Test in development environment
4. Deploy to production
5. Document changes in changelog

### Code Updates
1. Update relevant constants in `script.js`
2. Add new functions if needed
3. Test changes locally
4. Deploy through normal git workflow

## API Integration Guidelines

### External APIs
- Salary data APIs
- Job posting aggregators
- Training platform APIs
- Market trend data sources

### Internal APIs
- Firebase/Firestore interactions
- Authentication services
- Analytics tracking

## Code Organization

### Frontend
- `index.html`: Main application interface
- `script.js`: Application logic and dynamic data
- `styles.css`: Styling and layout

### Backend
- `firebase.js`: Database interactions
- `setup_recommendations.py`: Database population
- `analytics/`: Data analysis tools

### Documentation
- `docs/`: Documentation directory
- `DEVELOPMENT.md`: This file
- `README.md`: Project overview
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: System architecture

## Best Practices

### Data Updates
1. Salary Ranges
   - Update quarterly
   - Use reliable industry sources
   - Include regional variations

2. Training Resources
   - Review monthly
   - Verify links and costs
   - Update course availability

3. Technology Trends
   - Monitor industry news
   - Update as new tools emerge
   - Remove obsolete technologies

### Code Maintenance
1. Keep dynamic data separate from core logic
2. Document all data sources
3. Version control all changes
4. Maintain test coverage

## Security Considerations

1. Credentials
   - Store in environment variables
   - Never commit to repository
   - Regular rotation of API keys

2. User Data
   - Encrypt sensitive information
   - Follow data protection regulations
   - Regular security audits

## Deployment Process

1. Development
   - Local testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests

2. Staging
   - Full system testing
   - Data validation
   - Performance testing

3. Production
   - Gradual rollout
   - Monitoring
   - Backup procedures
